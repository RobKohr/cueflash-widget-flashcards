# cueflash-widget-flashcards

This is a widget for cueflash.com. You can use it as the 
basis for new widget by forking this repo. 

This repo is used as a flashcard deck for studying.

When creating your own, replace the widget.css, widget.html,
and widget.js content. 

You can test the code by loading the test.html file in your browser. It contains a deck of state capitals that will be loaded into the "deck" variable as a javascript global.
